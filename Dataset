🧠 Dataset Description: Brain Tumor MRI Images
🔗 Source
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle, under the title: Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/rm1000/brain-tumor-mri-scans?dataset_version_number=1

📦 Contents of the Dataset
The dataset consists of MRI scan images of the human brain, classified into four categories:
Glioma Tumor
Meningioma Tumor
Pituitary Tumor
No Tumor
Each category is stored in its respective folder. The images are labeled accordingly, making it a supervised multi-class classification dataset.

🖼️ Image Characteristics
Format: JPG or PNG
Color Space: Mostly grayscale (single channel), though some might be in RGB
Size: Varies across images (e.g., 512x512, 240x240), so resizing is required for model input
Modality: MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)

📊 Class Distribution
The dataset includes a balanced number of images across each class (in some versions, the dataset may be slightly imbalanced).
Example class counts (may vary based on dataset version):
Tumor Type	Number of Images
Glioma Tumor	826
Meningioma Tumor	822
Pituitary Tumor	827
No Tumor	395

(Note: Actual numbers should be verified based on your downloaded dataset.)

⚙️ Why this Dataset is Useful
Medical relevance: It mimics real-world MRI scan classification.
Labeled data: Each image is clearly labeled, enabling supervised learning.
Real patient data: MRI scans are taken from real patients (anonymized), making it suitable for clinical AI research.

🧹 Preprocessing Required
To make the dataset usable for CNN models, several preprocessing steps are applied:
Resizing all images to a standard size (e.g., 128×128 pixels).
Grayscale conversion (if images are not already in grayscale).
Normalization of pixel values to the range [0, 1].
One-hot encoding of categorical labels for classification.
Train-test split for model training and evaluation.
